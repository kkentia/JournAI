            Based on Plutchik's model, this wheel maps the relationships between 24 emotions. 
            Distance from the center shows intensity. Stars represent dyads (mix of two primary emotions). 
            Hover over any point to see its specific name (e.g., 'Ecstasy' for high-intensity 'Joy') and score.
